# CSCI538-Project
This code loads a glasses image and overlays it onto the eyes of the detected faces in the input image. 
You can replace the face.jpg and glasses.png files with your own images to test the code. Note that the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file is 
a pre-trained model for detecting facial landmarks using the Dlib library, which you can download from the official Dlib website.

pip install opencv-python
pip install CMake
pip install dlib
pip install imutils

Secondly, you need to download the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file, which is a pre-trained model for detecting facial landmarks using the Dlib library. You can download this file from the official Dlib website at http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2.

Once you have installed the necessary libraries and downloaded the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file, you can copy and paste the code I provided into a Python file and run it. Make sure to replace the file paths for the input image and the glasses image with your own file paths.
